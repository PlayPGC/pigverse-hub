# 🐷 PigVerse Hub

**PigVerse Hub** is the home of Piglet Growth Coin (PGC) — an interactive GameFi ecosystem where users buy piglet NFTs (tokens) and nurture them through realistic farming activities such as feeding, deworming, and treatment.  
Piglets grow in weight and value over time, impacting their in-game and tradable worth.

## 🌟 Features

- **NFT Piglet Growth** – Piglets evolve through daily farm actions.  
- **Breeding System** – Mature pigs can mate and produce NFT piglets.  
- **DeFi Farming** – Pig care items like feed and medicine are tradable assets.  
- **Scarcity-Driven Tokenomics** – PGC token mining is intentionally challenging to ensure scarcity.  
- **Meat Redemption** – Future integration to exchange pig value for real pig meat globally.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity + OpenZeppelin  
- **Blockchain**: Binance Smart Chain (BSC Testnet → Mainnet)  
- **NFT Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
